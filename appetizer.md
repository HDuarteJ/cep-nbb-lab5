# Buffalo Cauliflower Wings

## Ingredients

* ⅔ cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon sea salt
* ¾ cup water
* 1 cauliflower, about 2 pounds, broken into large florets
* Buffalo Sauce, for brushing
* Ranch dressing or vegan ranch, for dipping, optional

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and salt. Add the water and whisk until smooth. Add the cauliflower florets and stir to coat.
3. Lift the cauliflower florets out of the batter, allowing any excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to carefully flip the florets. Bake for another 10 minutes, swapping the pans on the oven racks.
4. Remove the cauliflower from the oven and brush with some of the buffalo sauce. Bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is dark and crisp around the edges.
5. Remove from the oven and brush with additional buffalo sauce. If desired, serve with ranch for dipping.
